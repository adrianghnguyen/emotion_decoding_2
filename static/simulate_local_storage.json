Sam doesn't have a lot of friends, and the few friends she has she doesn't hang out with or like much. She is also very introverted, so it's hard for her to make friends; therefore, naturally, I introduced her to some of my women friends. She particularly got along with one of my close friends very well, we'll call her Jenny. Jenny is very attractive and usually gets hit on a lot by both men and women. Since Sam and Jenny got along well, we hung out pretty often. 2 years ago, Sam came out to me that she's bisexual, and she had a lot of confusion and unanswered questions about herself and such, but she assured me she still loves me and wants to be with me. I decided to then pause on the idea of engagement while we discussed this new information and how it was affecting her. Fast forward, since we're spending so much time with Jenny, I guess Sam started to like her, but Sam never mentioned it to me, and I never thought of anything of it. But then things got weird; on my birthday, Jenny came with one of her boy toys, and Sam became sad, cold, and distant. I asked her what was wrong, but she said nothing, then started to cry uncontrollably, and we had to leave my birthday event. I was a bit upset at this since my friends came from far places to be there, but finally, she admitted to me she was sad because Jenny came with a guy and that Jenny was probably going to sleep with him. I asked why she cared so much about what Jenny did, and she said it didn't matter. Then we went to bed, and in the AM, she apologized.",

She wanted to do an open relationship instead but only open it for her and not me so she can explore since she's bi. I told her no. During the break, I guess she didn't have any luck; she didn't meet women on dating apps and was unable to hit it off. So she said she has no more questions and everything is good, so we went to therapy and started dating again. We stopped hanging with Jenny, and since Jenny was uncomfortable, she stopped hanging with us too. Jenny and I were close, but she understands why we can't all hang anymore. Things have been great lately, and I was going to propose on the Christmas trip, but last weekend during brunch, Sam broke down crying again and told me it's because she misses Jenny. And for me, that was the last straw.",
